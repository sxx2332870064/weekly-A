    <p><span style="color:darkcyan">Over the past few classes, we as beginners have dived into basic knowledge about the history, the functions, and characteristics about websites, as well as techniques on how to make our own html with some fancy displays.</span> <span style="color:rgb(53, 187, 189)">One specific phrase that really caught my attention was that the internet is like a pet cat where you kept it mostly to yourself in a comparison to the socialization activities of dog owners. Despite how it is so true in terms of the process of web development, I also liked this phrase because it suggested that websites that we are building are just like our pets that should be taken care of and be treated friendly with.</span></p>

    <p style="color:rgb(69, 212, 225)">We’ve also got to know many fantastic features when building up a website and how to make the appearance more attractive, although possible interactions that we’ve got so far are majorly for content viewings, it still surprised me on how innovative can artists be when making their artworks as interactive websites.</p>
    
    <p><span style="color:rgb(100, 214, 255)">Over the past weeks a thing I’ve noticed when using the internet myself was the wide range that websites can be associated with, from snow day calculators for fun (or functional), to daily news, along with online games or informational pages; the internet is now integrated into our daily lives so deep and it is so useful due to the freedom and spaces left for imaginations/creativities provided by the internet. </span><span style="color:rgb(81, 203, 255)"> The website is a relatively new technology in the field of art, but is showing tremendous effects and is providing numerous new ways for artists to develop, construct, and perform their thoughts and their works.
